* ls  (list file)

# Relative vs. Absolute Path
A file path is the directory that the file is in + its file name
For example:
the index.html is in /workspaces/8103-linux-demo/index.html
In Linux, absolute file begins witha / (the / is ROOT DIRECTORY)

A relative file path does not begin with forward slash
Or sometimes ./ to start a relative path
